# Dashboard

The dashboard was crafted using Power BI Desktop.

To achieve this, we established a seamless connection between Power BI and Synapse Analytics.

After entering the server name and password, the data is loaded into Power BI and the dashboard can be created.

The dashboard consist of 1 filter and 3 tiles. 

The filter empowers users to dynamically sort the data based on gender, facilitating comparative analysis between males and females.

Subsequently, the dashboard presents the count and percentage distribution of evaluations across different continents. This information derives from the continent column generated during the ETL process.

Additionally, insights into the duration of indoor stays chosen by study participants are provided. Notably, the option of 1-14 days emerged as the most commonly selected.

Lastly, a tile map visually depicts the countries where the survey was conducted, offering geographical context to the dataset.

Unfortunately, I was unable to share a link to the dashboard since my trial period in Power BI has ended. However, in the docs of this folder and below you can find a jpg of the complete dashboard.
